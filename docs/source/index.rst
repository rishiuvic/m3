Welcome to Lumache's documentation!
===================================

The M3 project delivers a sophisticated modelling platform that is built on the SPINE toolbox and contains pre-designed modelling workflows; these workflows can be used to simulate energy models to run in a pre-defined scenario by a simple plug-and-play feature. The platform supports models written in Python or Julia. 
The models supported and integrated within the M3 project currently include: 
COPPER: Canadian Opportunities for Planning and Production of Electricity Resources or COPPER is a multi-period, optimization-based capacity expansion model specifically designed for the Canadian context. It is employed to analyze Canada's electricity system transition under various carbon management policies. 
SILVER: SILVER or Strategic Integration of is an optimisation dispatch model. The model performs a three-stage optimization for electricity dispatch within a user-defined scenario. 
The other embedded components of the project are: 
IDEA: IDEA is a platform that binds multiple visualization scripts to display model outputs as interactive plots within a website-like interface design. 
CODERS: Canadian Open-source Database for Energy Research and Systems-Modelling (CODERS) is an open-source database including electricity system data related to generation, storage, transmission, substations and system operations, hourly and annual provincial electricity demand data, interprovincial and international electricity transfers and transmission interties, and spatial data related to Canadaâ€™s electricity networks
