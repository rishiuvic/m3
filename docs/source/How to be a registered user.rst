Be a registered user
--------
In order to be a registered user for the CODERS database, which is integral to running the M3 model workflow projects, you would need a unique API key tagged against your name. Currently, the process of this API-key generation isn't automated and one has to go through the following manual steps to get it-

One has to email their access request for API at jmonroe@uvic.ca

The team shall acknowledge your request and send you an agreement to sign digitally. This end-user license agreement(EULA) ensures that the database is used ethically and burdens the user with a sense of responsibility.
Once we receive back the counter-signed EULA, we generate a unique API-key for the user and email it to them.
